# Vocabulary Trainer

The Vocabulary Trainer is designed to facilitate language learning by offering personalized lessons and vocabulary exercises to enhance foreign language proficiency.

## Overview

The application supports multiple users, providing a structured approach to vocabulary training. It features an integrated vocabulary list, ranked by word frequency, to guide learners from the most common to the least common words.

The system is modular and extensible, allowing for the seamless addition of new task types, templates, languages, and learning algorithms.

### Lesson Structure

Each session generates a customized lesson utilizing spaced repetition techniques. The app recommends new words to learn and identifies words from previous lessons that require review.

### Task Generation

For each target word, the application selects a task designed to challenge the user in recalling or using the word and its translation. Tasks can be sourced from the database or generated using artificial intelligence. The variety of tasks is supported by a flexible template system, allowing for numerous task configurations.

### Task Types

Tasks can take multiple forms, such as multiple-choice questions or translation exercises. Each task type defines the structure and requirements, which are further refined by specific templates.

### Task Templates

Task templates outline the parameters and objectives for each task type. For example, a multiple-choice question template may require users to select the correct translation of a word or identify an incorrect meaning.

### AI-Generated Resources

Templates specify the resources used in tasks. These resources, which include language elements associated with target words, are generated by AI and integrated into tasks via LangChain processes.

### Evaluation

The evaluation of tasks varies based on their type. Multiple-choice questions are straightforward, while free-input translation exercises require more sophisticated evaluation, potentially involving AI-assisted methods.

### Database

The database manages data on words, resources, tasks, templates, and user lessons. SQLAlchemy is employed to define the object-relational schema and facilitate database interactions.

### Supported Languages

Currently, the application supports German vocabulary. The German vocabulary list is based on a frequency list derived from a 100,000-word corpus available at [Wortschatz Leipzig](https://wortschatz.uni-leipzig.de/en/download/German).

## Technologies Used

### Backend

#### Python & Flask

The backend is developed using Python with Flask as the web framework. Flask is chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, allowing for efficient setup and integration of components such as database connections and REST API construction.

#### SQLAlchemy

SQLAlchemy serves as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) tool, facilitating database interactions.

#### SQLite

SQLite is utilized as the database solution due to its lightweight, file-based nature, which eliminates the need for a separate server, making it ideal for a small-scale application.

#### LangChain with OpenAI GPT-4

LangChain integrates OpenAI GPT-4 for generating tasks and grading user responses.

### Frontend

- **Next.js:** A React framework used for building server-side rendered (SSR) and statically generated web applications.
- **React:** A JavaScript library for constructing user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications.
- **TypeScript:** A strongly typed programming language that enhances JavaScript by providing better tooling and early error detection through type checking.
- **Axios:** A promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js, facilitating HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for quickly building custom user interfaces.

### Deployment Instructions

1. Install all requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.
2. For the frontend, run `pnpm i`.
3. Start the backend server by executing `python app_factory.py`.
4. Launch the development frontend server with `pnpm dev`.
