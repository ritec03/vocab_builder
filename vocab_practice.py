"""
we have a chain that takes a word, translates it
we have a chain that takes a word in german and creates a sentence with it
we have a chain that takes a sentence and a transaltion and a word and evaluates the translation

Now we need: 
* something that actually chooses the words or requests word inputs
    * 

Example interaction:
1. User starts a new lesson and either chooses category or inputs a list of words that the user wants to learn.
2. The bot constructs a word bucket to be trained during the session.
3. The bot starts to construct sentences (or pull sentences for the word if some already exist)
4. The user performs a task on the constructed sentence. For now, just stick with translation task.

How to create an interactive interface?
* Create an agent that will guide the user to starting the session.
    * The agent will either create words to study, or get input from the user about the words.
    * The agent will then start ??? a chain on the word list that will guide the user???
    * save the state from the session.
    * provide summary of the session.

    
This will require:
* creating a dummy interactive CL application
* figure out how to accept and wait for human input in LangChain chains?
    * or simply construct an application around it.
